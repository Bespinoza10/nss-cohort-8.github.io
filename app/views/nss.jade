    h3 Summary of Cohort 8's experience as NSS Students

    p Our experience at NSS? Intense and Intensive. For the past six months, we spent the day at school
      learning new and challenging material, writing lots of code and working with other students on projects. And 
      on nights and weekends, we went to meetups, mixers, hackathons, and worked with other members of the 
      community on more projects. And wrote more code.
    p The NSS curriculum has taught us the skills and technologies required 
      to become a full-stack software developer. And we are now ready and willing
      to use our new knowledge-and keep on 
      learning and growing as software development professionals.
    p Below are some of the technologies we've learned in the last six months!
